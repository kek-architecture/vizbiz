          <br>
          Jason Bergeron is a U.S. licensed architect, architecture visualizer, and writer. After graduating from the University of Arkansas in 1999, Jason worked as an architect in New York City
          before ultimately settling in Vienna, Austria in 2003. As a matter of survival, he turned to architectural visualization as way to delay learning German. Over the years, he has worked for
          numerous architects and visualization offices and can now easily recite the Photoshop menus in sweetly English-accented German. More recently, Jason co-founded the d2 Conference, which has
          become the largest yearly gathering of arch-viz artists in the world. The combination of working as an architect, a visualizer, and organizing an arch-viz conference has given him a unique
          view into the arch-viz world, while also providing him with great motivation to work on issues that impact the industry.
